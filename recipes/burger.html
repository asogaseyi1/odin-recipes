        <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.</p><p>Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
            <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. <p>Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</p></li>
            <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. <p>Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty)</p> <p>and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down.</p> <p>You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</p></li>
            <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. <p>Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese.</p> <p>Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</p></li>
        </ol>
